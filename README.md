Plugin
-----
Sorry I don't have the plugin finished, didn't made it in time due to work and some other unplanned things. Please consider as my participation never happened :)
You can see the code I already have, which totally isn't complete. I'll finish this plugin later on and put it on BukkitDev. I'll also participate next year and make it in time then (I hope :p).
